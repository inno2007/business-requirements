# Requirement Gathering Techniques

Requirement gathering is the foundation of building effective business systems. It ensures that what gets developed truly meets the users’ needs and business goals.

## 1. Why Requirement Gathering Matters

- Users often don’t know exactly what they need.
- Miscommunication between business and developers leads to incorrect features.
- Visual models help clarify complex requirements better than plain text.

## 2. Requirement Gathering Techniques

Below are common techniques used to collect, validate, and refine system requirements:

### 1. Survey

| Feature         | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Method**      | Quantitative: uses forms or questionnaires. |
| **When to Use** | To reach a large audience, often anonymously. |
| **Considerations** | Low response rate, needs clear and neutral questions. |

---

### 2. Interview

| Feature         | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Method**      | Qualitative: deep exploration of opinions or needs. |
| **When to Use** | Small sample sizes (7–10 people) with in-depth discussions. |
| **Considerations** | Requires good listening and interpretation skills. |

---

### 3. Document Analysis

| Feature         | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Method**      | Review existing documents like system manuals, reports, or specs. |
| **When to Use** | To understand legacy systems or gather baseline functionality. |
| **Considerations** | May produce too much irrelevant information. Stay focused. |

---

### 4. Observation

| Feature         | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Method**      | Watch how users interact with existing systems. |
| **When to Use** | When users struggle to describe what they do. |
| **Considerations** | Ethical issues: people behave differently under observation. |

---

### 5. Prototyping

| Feature         | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Method**      | Build a basic model or mock-up of the system for feedback. |
| **When to Use** | When requirements are unclear or users don’t know what they want. |
| **Considerations** | Can lead to "scope creep" if users keep requesting changes. |

---

### 6. Joint Application Design (JAD)

| Feature         | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| **Method**      | Collaborative workshop between users and IT staff. |
| **When to Use** | At the start of a project, for focused, small-scope applications. |
| **Considerations** | Less effective in large or complex projects. |

## 3. Choosing the Right Technique

You don’t have to pick just one. Combine multiple methods for more complete and validated requirements. For example:

- Start with interviews → then survey to scale up
- Observe workflows → then prototype an improved version

---

## Summary

Requirement gathering is critical for success. Use a mix of techniques to collect rich, accurate, and actionable system requirements from users, documents, and observation.
