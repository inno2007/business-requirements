# Agile Systems Development

Agile development is a flexible, iterative approach to building software that prioritizes collaboration, rapid delivery, and continuous improvement.

## 1. Why Agile?

Agile addresses the limitations of traditional, rigid development models by offering:

- Quick iterations and releases
- Continuous feedback from customers
- Flexibility to adapt to changing requirements
- Enhanced collaboration between teams and stakeholders

## 2. Popular Agile Methods

| Method     | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Scrum**  | Structured with roles (e.g., Product Owner, Scrum Master), time-boxed sprints, and regular reviews. |
| **Kanban** | Visual workflow management using task boards to control flow and limit work in progress. |
| **Scrumban** | Hybrid method combining Scrum's structure with Kanbanâ€™s visual flexibility. |

## 3. Agile Process Stages

1. **Scope and Prioritize Tasks**  
   - Identify user stories and determine their importance.

2. **Diagram Requirements for Sprint**  
   - Design and clarify what will be built in the sprint.

3. **Construction/Iteration**  
   - Build and test software incrementally in time-boxed sprints.

4. **Release Iteration**  
   - Deliver working features and gather user feedback.

5. **Production and Support**  
   - Maintain and enhance software based on feedback.

6. **Retirement**  
   - Phase out old features or replace the system when obsolete.

## 4. Benefits of Agile

| Advantage           | Explanation |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Continuous Delivery | Working software released at the end of each sprint. |
| Customer Satisfaction | Fast feedback loops improve alignment with user needs. |
| Flexibility         | Easily adapt to new or changing requirements. |
| Collaboration       | Daily stand-ups and reviews strengthen team communication. |
| Focus on Quality    | Frequent testing and code refactoring ensure robust solutions. |

## 5. Drawbacks of Agile

| Limitation          | Explanation |
|---------------------|-------------|
| Limited Documentation | Agile values working software over comprehensive docs. |
| Unclear Requirements  | Requirements evolve, which may delay initial planning. |
| Effort Estimation     | Difficult to predict time/resources for future work. |
| Risk of Scope Creep   | Changes during sprints may lead to scope bloat. |

## 6. When to Use Agile

Agile is ideal for:
- Projects with **changing or unclear requirements**
- **Small to medium-sized teams**
- Projects that **require frequent delivery and customer input**
- Environments that support **flexible architectures and team autonomy**

Avoid Agile if:
- The team requires **fixed, upfront planning**
- The project must comply with **strict documentation standards**
- **Customer availability is limited** for regular feedback

Agile empowers cross-functional teams to build better software faster by focusing on feedback, adaptability, and value delivery. Choose the method that fits project scale, team structure, and stakeholder involvement.
